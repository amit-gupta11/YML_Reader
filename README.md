# Project Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the project repository using the following command:
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```
Replace `<repository_url>` with the URL of the repository you want to clone.

## Step 2: Open the Project

1. Open your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code).
2. Import the cloned project into the IDE.

## Step 3: Build the Project

Open the terminal in your IDE or navigate to the project's root directory and run the following command:
